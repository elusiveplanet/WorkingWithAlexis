# Working With Alexis

:wave: Hey! If you're here, we're probably going to be working together in some capacity—I look forward to it! To hopefully give you some context as to who I am, what I stand for, and how my mind works, I assembled this document.

### I try to abide by these core principles.
#### :busts_in_silhouette: Mutual Trust and Respect
Pretty simple—I trust you, I hope that you trust me. Same goes for respect.
#### :information_desk_person: Invest in Others
I consider myself an enabler at heart—this means that I love getting the opportunity to invest in others and help them do the best work of their lives. It is my hope that you do the same.
#### :earth_americas: It Takes All Kinds
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are a part of everything I do, and it genuinely takes all kinds of people to make something great.
#### :bow: Practice Empathy
Empathy is so important in our daily lives, from interacting with customers and stakeholders to talking to coworkers and family members. It's a crucial part of being a good leader, and I expect that you share this value with me.
#### :sound: Communication
I appreciate over-communication over under. Soft responses like “will read later” or a reacji in Slack are greatly appreciated.
#### :repeat: Consistent and Timely Feedback
Feedback fuels everything I do—I expect that you will give me timely, descriptive, and actionable feedback consistently. I'll make sure to always do the same for you.
#### :milky_way: Build for Everyone
Accessibility is at the forefront of every design decision that I make. Disabilities come in many different forms, and making sure that people of all abilities are able to use whatever it is that we're building is incredibly important to me. Let's work to make this world we all share more equitable for everyone.
#### :office: Customer/Stakeholder Obsession
Leaders start with the customer/stakeholder and work backwards. I work to find what the customer needs and desires from a product before designing, and strive to maintain that vision throughout development. I'm not afraid of dropping something in pursuit of what the customer needs.
#### :key: Ownership
Leaders are also owners. I think long term, and refuse to sacrifice long term value for short term results. I never say "that's not my job."
#### :arrow_double_up: Do more with less
Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.
#### :microscope: Invent and Simplify
I always strive to find new ways to simplify. New ideas come from everywhere.
#### :ocean: Dive Deep
I do my best to stay connected to the details and operate at all levels.
#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Deliver Results and Take Pride
I strive to deliver quality results in a timely manner. I rise against any potential setbacks and never settle for less.
#### :sparkles: Stay Playful (and use Emoji/Reacji!)
I'm here to do what I love, writing code, building cool things, and help people do the best work of their lives. That's what I find fun, and I hope that we'll be able to have some fun together along the way too. Emoji and reacji are my favorite, and keep things informal. I thrive in spaces that allow me to be my full unadulterated self, and I hope you can join me in doing so.


Let's work together and do the best work of our lives! :beers: :confetti_ball:
