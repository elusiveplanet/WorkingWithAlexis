# Working With Alexis

:wave: Welcome! I wrote this doc to give you some context as to who I am, what I stand for, and how I operate.

### I try to abide by these core principles.
#### :busts_in_silhouette: People First, Always
I firmly believe that psychological safety is critical to the success of any engineering team. Learning means mistakes will happen—creating a culture of support and safety means mistakes can happen in the first place.
#### :information_desk_person: Invest in Others
I consider myself an enabler at heart and appreciate the opportunity to invest in others and help them do their best work.
#### :milky_way: Build for Everyone
Accessibility is at the forefront of every design decision that I make. Making sure everyone can use what we build is central to my mission.
#### :bow: Compassion by Default
To create world-class products and engineering teams, I look to first understand how I can support both teammates and users. I take a vested interest in their success and well-being.
#### :sound: Writing > Talking
I appreciate over-communication vs under. Soft responses like “will read later” or a reacji in Slack are greatly appreciated. Writing in-depth helps me drive clarity of thought in strategic and tactical discussions. I've found this creates a culture where teammates are eager to and can easily share and collaborate.
#### :repeat: Consistent and Timely Feedback
For me, feedback builds trust and transparency. It’s how your team isn't left in the dark or fearing the worst. I strive to provide descriptive, clear, and actionable feedback consistently, timely, and privately (unless otherwise appropriate). Feedback fuels everything I do—I'll be looking forward to your feedback too!
#### :sparkles: Intrinsically Curious and Naturally Playful (Emoji/Reacji!)
I'm here to do what I love—writing code, building great product, and helping people do their best work. That's what I find most rewarding, and I have a lot of faith that we'll have some fun together along the way.


Let's build something incredible! :confetti_ball:
