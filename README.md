# Working With Alexis

:wave: Welcome! I wrote this doc to share who I am, what I stand for, what I prefer, and how I operate.

### I strive to uphold these core principles.

#### :busts_in_silhouette: People First, Always

I firmly believe that psychological safety is critical to the success of any engineering team. Learning means mistakes will happen—creating a culture of support and safety means mistakes ***can*** happen in the first place.

#### :information_desk_person: Invest in Others

I consider myself an enabler at heart and appreciate the opportunity to invest in others and help them do their best work.

#### :milky_way: Build for Everyone

Accessibility is at the forefront of every design decision that I make. Ensuring equitable access to what we build is central to my mission.

#### :bow: Compassion by Default

To create world-class products and engineering teams, I first look to understand how I can best support both teammates and users. I take a vested interest in their success and strive to be their strongest advocate.

#### :sound: Writing > Talking

Writing in-depth helps me drive clarity of thought in strategic and tactical discussions. I've found this quality in teams creates an environment where teammates can quickly and openly collaborate while also investing in the future by creating a detailed paper trail.

In the long term, this emphasizes a culture of creating thoughtful documentation, reducing friction during the onboarding process.

This trait also lends itself to a culture that is deeply respectful and mindful of synchronous time. When everyone is on the same page before a meeting, the conversation shifts from briefing and education to analysis, discussion, and debate. This directly translates into less time spent in meetings, and affords us more focus/flow time.

Additionally, I prefer over-communication vs under. Soft responses like “will read later” or a reacji :eyes: in Slack are greatly appreciated.

#### :repeat: Consistent and Timely Feedback

For me, feedback builds trust and transparency. It’s how your team isn't left in the dark about where they stand or fearing the worst. I strive to provide descriptive, clear, and actionable feedback consistently, timely, and privately (unless otherwise appropriate). Feedback fuels everything I do—I'll be looking forward to your feedback too!

#### :sparkles: Intrinsically Curious and Naturally Playful (Emoji/Reacji!)

I'm here to do what I love—writing code, building great product, and bringing out the best in others. That's what I find most rewarding, and I have plenty of faith that we'll have some fun together along the way.


Let's build something incredible! :confetti_ball:
