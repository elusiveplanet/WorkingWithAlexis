# Working With Alexis

:wave: Welcome! I wrote this doc to give you some context as to who I am, what I stand for, and how I operate.

### I try to abide by these core principles.
#### :busts_in_silhouette: People First, Always
I firmly believe psychological safety is critical to the success of any engineering team. Learning means mistakes will happen, it's up to us to create a culture of support after key failures to ensure constructive learning can happen.
#### :information_desk_person: Invest in Others
I consider myself an enabler at heart—this means that I love getting the opportunity to invest in others and help them do the best work of their lives. It is my hope that you do the same.
#### :earth_americas: It Takes All Kinds
It's clear to me that it takes all kinds of people to make something incredible. Prioritizing diverse world-views is the perfect source of fuel for innovation.
#### :bow: Practice Empathy
To create world-class products and engineering teams, I strive to first understand the needs of users and teammates.
#### :sound: Communication
I appreciate over-communication over under. Soft responses like “will read later” or a reacji in Slack are greatly appreciated.
#### :repeat: Consistent and Timely Feedback
Feedback fuels everything I do—I expect that you will give me timely, descriptive, and actionable feedback consistently. I'll make sure to always do the same for you.
#### :milky_way: Build for Everyone
Accessibility is at the forefront of every design decision that I make. Making sure that people of all abilities are able to use what we build is my mission.
#### :sparkles: Stay Playful (and use Emoji/Reacji!)
I'm here to do what I love, writing code, building great product, and help people do the best work of their lives. That's what I find most rewarding, and I hope that we'll be able to have some fun together along the way too.


Let's work together and do the best work of our lives! :confetti_ball:
