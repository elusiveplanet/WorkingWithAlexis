# Working With Alexis

:wave: Welcome! I wrote this doc to give you some context as to who I am, what I stand for, and how I operate.

### I abide by these core principles.

#### :busts_in_silhouette: People First, Always

I firmly believe that psychological safety is critical to the success of any engineering team. Learning means mistakes will happen—creating a culture of support and safety means mistakes ***can*** happen in the first place.

#### :information_desk_person: Invest in Others

I consider myself an enabler at heart and appreciate the opportunity to invest in others and help them do their best work.

#### :milky_way: Build for Everyone

Accessibility is at the forefront of every design decision that I make. Ensuring equitable access to what we build is central to my mission.

#### :bow: Compassion by Default

To create world-class products and engineering teams, I look to first understand how I can best support both teammates and users. I take a vested interest in their success and strive to be their strongest advocate.

#### :sound: Writing > Talking

I appreciate over-communication vs under. Soft responses like “will read later” or a reacji in Slack are greatly appreciated. Writing in-depth helps me drive clarity of thought in strategic and tactical discussions. I've found this creates a culture where teammates can eagerly and easily collaborate while also reducing friction during the onboarding process. 

This trait also lends itself to a culture that is deeply respectful and mindful of synchronous time. When everyone is one the same page before a meeting, the meeting shifts from education to analysis, discussion, and debate. This directly translates into less time spent in meetings, and affords us more focus/flow time.

#### :repeat: Consistent and Timely Feedback

For me, feedback builds trust and transparency. It’s how your team isn't left in the dark about where they stand or fearing the worst. I strive to provide descriptive, clear, and actionable feedback consistently, timely, and privately (unless otherwise appropriate). Feedback fuels everything I do—I'll be looking forward to your feedback too!

#### :sparkles: Intrinsically Curious and Naturally Playful (Emoji/Reacji!)

I'm here to do what I love—writing code, building great product, and enabling others to do their best work. That's what I find most rewarding, and I have plenty of faith that we'll have some fun together along the way.


Let's build something incredible! :confetti_ball:
